              <h5 className="description">
              an artist, educator and writer based in Chicago where he currently teaches new media art at the University of Illinois at Chicago. His projects explore the ways that sensual and conceptual qualities of objects, environments and people, are influenced by their relationship to their own digital representations. The objects, installations, and performances he makes are often transmedial in nature; and offer unique views of their subject matter across disparate spatial, physical and digital platforms. Recent projects have explored themes like computational periscopy, urban screen ecologies, and the geography of the internet.

In addition his writing has been published in Hyperallergic and he has been a guest critic for the architecture department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
